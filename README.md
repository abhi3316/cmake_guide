Learning cmake from step1

There are application sources inside app and lib sources inside lib. The idea
is to build the library and application separate and link it at the end.
we are interested in designing the build system(CMake based) with this project, not in the code and the application feature.

Comments are provided in all the CMakeList.txt files.
